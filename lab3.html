            <h3>PROFILE</h3>
            <p class="line">
                Mesut Ozil is a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Super Lig club
                Fenerbahçe. Ozil is known for his technical skills, creativity, passing skills, and vision. He can also
                play as a wide midfielder.
                Born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Ozil began his senior club career playing for hometown club Schalke 04,
                before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, his
                individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010. There, he helped the club win a La Liga
                title, and ranked first in league assists for three straight seasons. In 2013, Ozil was the subject of
                a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth up to
                £42.5 million, becoming the most expensive German player ever at the time. In England, he won three FA
                Cups and helped end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought, while recording the second most assists ever
                in a Premier League season. In 2021, Ozil joined Fenerbahçe on a free transfer.

            <p>Company Name / 2014 Present</p>
            <p> A German international, Ozil holds the record for the most German Player of the Year awards. He made his
                senior debut for the Germany national team in 2009 at age 20, and appeared in five major tournaments.
                He was the top assist provider at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, where he helped Germany
                twice reach the semi-final. Özil helped Germany win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but retired from
                international competition in 2018, alleging discrimination and disrespect by the German Football
                Association (DFB) and the German media.</p>

            <p>Company Name/2110-2014</p>
            <p> Following an injury to Marco Reus in a warm-up game, Ozil was moved from his customary number 10 role into
                the left-winger position for the majority of the tournament. He started all seven of Germany's 2014
                FIFA World Cup games, and helped Germany make history by becoming the first European team to win the
                World Cup in South America. Ozil scored the decisive goal in the 119th minute of Germany's 2–1 round
                of 16 victory over Algeria, a match widely praised as one of the most entertaining of the tournament.
                Ozil then provided an assist for Sami Khedira in Germany's 7–1 semi-final win over Brazil. The
                goal Özil assisted, with a clever pass, made the score 5–0 to Germany after just 29 minutes. The shocking
                nature of the 5-goal flurry generated worldwide astonishment.[217]</p>
